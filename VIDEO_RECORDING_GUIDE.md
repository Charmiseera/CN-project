## Suggested Recording Structure (10-15 minutes)

### 1. Introduction (1-2 minutes)
**Team Member 1:**
- Introduce the team and project title: "Routing Algorithms Visualizer"
- Briefly explain the purpose: "A web-based interactive tool to visualize routing algorithms used in computer networks"
- Mention the technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vis.js library

### 2. Features Overview (2-3 minutes)
**Team Member 2:**
- Show the user interface
- Explain the sidebar controls:
  - Add Node button
  - Add Edge button
  - Manual Input option
  - Clear Canvas button
- Demonstrate algorithm selection dropdown:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
  - Link State (LS)
  - Distance Vector (DV)
- Show speed control slider and start node input

### 3. Live Demonstration - Creating a Graph (2-3 minutes)
**Team Member 3:**
- Click "Add Node" and create 4-5 nodes on canvas
- Switch to "Add Edge" mode
- Drag between nodes to create edges
- Enter weights for each edge when prompted
- Show how nodes can be dragged to rearrange

### 4. Algorithm Demonstrations (5-7 minutes)

#### Demo 1: Dijkstra's Algorithm
**Team Member 1:**
- Select "Dijkstra's Algorithm" from dropdown
- Enter starting node (e.g., "1")
- Adjust animation speed
- Click "Run Visualizer"
- Explain what's happening:
  - Visited nodes turn color
  - Edges being explored are highlighted
  - Show the execution logs panel
  - Display final routing table with destinations, costs, and next hops

#### Demo 2: Bellman-Ford Algorithm
**Team Member 2:**
- Clear the previous results or use same graph
- Select "Bellman-Ford Algorithm"
- Run and explain the differences
- Show how it handles the same graph differently

#### Demo 3: Link State or Distance Vector
**Team Member 3:**
- Select another algorithm (Link State or Distance Vector)
- Run and explain the routing protocol simulation
- Show the execution logs and routing table

### 5. Code Walkthrough (2-3 minutes)
**Team Member 4:**
- Open the project folder structure
- Briefly show key files:
  - `index.html` - Main page structure
  - `style.css` - Styling and theme
  - `js/main.js` - UI interactions and event handling
  - `js/graph-manager.js` - Graph data management
  - `js/algorithms.js` - Algorithm implementations
- Open one algorithm function and explain the logic briefly

### 6. Conclusion (1 minute)
**Team Member 1 or All Together:**
- Summarize the key features
- Mention potential applications (networking education, algorithm learning)
- Thank you message

## Recording Tips

1. **Screen Setup:**
   - Use screen recording software (OBS Studio, Zoom, or any screen recorder)
   - Enable webcam to show your face
   - Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications
   - Test audio before starting

2. **Before Recording:**
   - Prepare a sample graph beforehand for quick demo
   - Have the project open in the browser
   - Have VS Code or text editor ready for code walkthrough
   - Practice the flow once

3. **During Recording:**
   - Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
   - Point out important features as you demonstrate
   - If you make a mistake, pause and continue (you can edit later)
   - Show enthusiasm about the project!

4. **Video Quality:**
   - Record in 1080p if possible
   - Ensure good lighting for face visibility
   - Use a decent microphone or clear audio
   - Keep video length between 10-15 minutes

## Quick Demo Script Examples

### When Adding Nodes:
*"Here I'm clicking on the canvas to add nodes. Each node represents a router in our network. The nodes are automatically numbered."*

### When Adding Edges:
*"Now I'll connect these nodes. I click 'Add Edge', then drag from one node to another. The system prompts me to enter the cost or distance for this link."*

### When Running Algorithm:
*"Let's run Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node 1. Watch how the algorithm visits nodes and explores edges. The colors show which nodes have been processed and which edges are part of the shortest path tree."*

### When Showing Logs:
*"The execution logs panel shows each step of the algorithm. At the end, we can see the complete routing table showing the shortest path costs and next hops for each destination."*
